2. **Choose Difficulty**: Select Easy (5 min), Intermediate (3 min), or Hard (1 min)
3. **Audio Settings**: Use the global sound toggle if needed
4. **Read Instructions**: Review the "How to Play" panel if needed

### Gameplay Flow
1. **Initialization Phase**:
   - Game spawns 45 cards in a 5x9 grid
   - 3 unique hand cards are selected and displayed
   - Collection grid is prepared for matched pairs

2. **Memorization Phase** (10 seconds):
   - All cards are face-up, showing their designs
   - Study the positions of cards matching your hand (bottom of screen)
   - Use this time to plan your strategy
   - Audio feedback indicates phase transitions

3. **Game Phase**:
   - Cards flip face-down automatically after 10 seconds
   - Click cards to flip them and find matches
   - Successfully matched cards move to the collection grid with animations
   - Audio feedback for correct/incorrect matches
   - Continue until all hand cards are matched or time runs out

4. **Completion**:
   - **Win**: Match all cards before time expires with victory audio
   - **Lose**: Time runs out before completing all matches with appropriate feedback

### Hand Cards
- Located at the bottom of the screen
- Shows 3 unique cards you need to find pairs for
- Each card type has exactly 4 copies in the grid (12 total matching cards)
- Cards remain visible throughout the game for reference
- Static display with disabled colliders for performance
